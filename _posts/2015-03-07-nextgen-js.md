title: Next-generation JavaScript Client Frameworks / Libraries
---
The landscape of JavaScript frameworks / libraries is changing fast. What started out as way to handle the DOM better through
declarative data binding has evolved into a competitive niche with Google and Facebook pitching contrasting
ideas and un expected collaborations -- [a Angular 2 is built on TypeScript](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/typescript/archive/2015/03/05/angular-2-0-built-on-typescript.aspx). So with ES6 on the horizon this is how it looking:

* Angular 2.0
* Aurelia
* Ember.js

Now you are probably thinking where is React on that list. The guys at React say that it's the V in MVC. But what does this mean for dynamic client UIs?

In the next couple of posts, I will explore this landscape with the intention of gaining a better understanding of where we may be heading. All I can say now is that will all these options, it's a great time to be a client side developer.
