title:  Up and running with Aurelia
---
[Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) is the latest incarnation from [Rob Eisenberg](http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/). If you have used [Durandal 2.0](http://durandaljs.com/) and liked it, then this may just be the framework for your next App. I really liked Durandal 2.0, and used it on two projects before I dove into Angular 1.x. 

Aurelia's documentation is quiet good, as a walk through of the "getting started" section went without a hitch. Setting up a modern JavaScript App using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and boostrapping a project with -- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is really a breeze and if you have not tried it, you should give it a go.

I will be restructuring the default skeleton app to build a typical ecommerce app with the intention of pushing Aurelia to it's limits. This should reveal all it's capabilities. During this time I  will share my thoughts on the conventions of this framework, tasks such as routing, binding and templating. This should be fun and I will keep you posted.
